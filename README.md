# GraphQL demo app

## About the project

Project done as a part of Kata's Challenge at Globant.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, give clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more.
